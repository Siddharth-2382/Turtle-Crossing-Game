# Turtle Crossing Game
This is a simple game called "Turtle Crossing". The objective of the game is to help the turtle cross the road safely without getting hit by any cars. The game is built using Python's Turtle module and uses Object Oriented Programming concepts.

## How to Play
1. Run the `main.py` file using any Python IDE or from the command line.
2. Use the Up arrow key to move the turtle forward.
3. Dodge the incoming cars from right to left on the road.
4. If the turtle reaches the top edge of the screen, the player levels up and the car speed increases.
5. If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over and everything stops.

## Project Structure
The project has the following files:

- `main.py`: This is the main script that runs the game.
- `player.py`: This file contains the `Player` class which represents the turtle in the game.
- `car_manager.py`: This file contains the `CarManager` class which manages the cars in the game.
- `scoreboard.py`: This file contains the `Scoreboard` class which keeps track of the player's score and level.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (pre-installed in most Python distributions)

## Credits
This game was created by me using Python's Turtle module.
